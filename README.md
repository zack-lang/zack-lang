👋 Hi, I'm @zack-lang.

I'm a tech enthusiast with a passion for backend development and cloud technologies. My skills span multiple languages like Golang, Node.js, Java, and Python, and I'm always eager to learn new ones.

🌱 Currently, I'm diving into the world of DevOps and cloud native app development, seeking to master tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS.

️ I'm looking to collaborate on projects that leverage my backend expertise and cloud knowledge. Specifically, I'm interested in:

- Building robust and scalable APIs: RESTful, GraphQL, real-time, you name it!
- Automating DevOps pipelines: Streamlining deployments and infrastructure management.
- Developing cloud-native microservices: Architecting distributed and fault-tolerant systems.
- Contributing to open-source projects: Sharing my skills and learning from the community.
